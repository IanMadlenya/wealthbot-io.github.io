# When you trend on github…

Update: we’ve actually reached #1 :)
#1 trending project on github

…

It feels good, when your baby project becomes very “trendy” overnight.

Today, we just hit #1 in the world on github:

Oh how trendy..

However, with that comes a number of responsibilities to the community and developers.
One of which, was to provide vagrant setup (which I will write about in an upcoming post).

The other, of course, is establishing an awesome way to perform CI (continuous integration), code coverage with coveralls and general code audit with code climate.

These tools are very important for every full stack developer to implement, because today our life gets infinitely easier, if we can automate our workflows.

By the way, that’s what [wealthbot.io](http://wealthbot.io) is all about — automation
