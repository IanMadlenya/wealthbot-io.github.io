TL;DR: Yes! And wealthbot.io is the platform to prove that out.

> Is Fintech ready for Open Source?

The first time I asked this question was in Tisch Hall at the NYU Stern School of Business at an entrepreneurship festival. 

The topic of conversation was “Innovation in Financial Technology”. 

The panel included innovators like Eli W of Betterment, X of small bank... 

The auditorium was packed. 

The answer? A resounding "Maybe". 

I've been asking the question since. I've asked lawyers and fintech meetup groups. I asked the professor of Management Information Systems at Stern, the head of strategy at a major investment bank and the head of sales at Thinknum. 

Sometime I get better than maybe, I get "That's a great idea, but how will you make money?" 

So instead of asking, we decided to find out for ourselves. But more on that later. First, let's go back to the beginning. 

> I'm doing a (free) operating system (just a hobby, won't be big and professional ...

Linus Torvalds said this when he released the Linux source code to "the wild". At the time that meant posting it on a Usenet newsgroup, today he'd probably upload it to Github. 

Of course Linus didn't invent the concept of open source, that honor is split among early day programmers who believed that the more eyes on the code the better. The open source movement was launched by Richard Stallman in 1983.

But Linus contribution could be considered the most influential. 

Wikipedia (another open sourced project) nicely sums up the impact of the linux kernel: "The Linux kernel has since expanded to support a huge array of computer architectures, many more than other operating systems or kernels. Linux rapidly attracted developers and users who adapted code from other free software projects for use with the new operating system. The Linux kernel has received contributions from nearly 12,000 programmers from more than 1,200 companies, including some of the largest software and hardware vendors."

# What is open source?
Open source software is software whose source code is available for modification or enhancement by anyone.

"Source code" is the part of software that most computer users don't ever see; it's the code computer programmers can manipulate to change how a piece of software—a "program" or "application"—works. Programmers who have access to a computer program's source code can improve that program by adding features to it or fixing parts that don't always work correctly.

# Current state of open source software, 50,000 foot view.
Over the years, open source software has often surpassed it's private competition in terms of security, reliability and utility. It's also slowly evolved from back-end building block (think Linux, Apache, PHP) reserved for the techiest of techies, into an effective tool for every user at every level of the full stack.

 Good examples of open-source products are: 
 * Apache HTTP Server, 
 * the e-commerce platform Magento, 
 * internet browsers Mozilla Firefox and Chromium (the project where the vast majority of development of the freeware Google Chrome is done) 
 * the full office suite LibreOffice
 * Wordpress, the content management system powering 30% of the world's websites

# What is Fintech?

![fintech google trends](/images/Google_Trends_-_Web_Search_interest__fintech_-_Worldwide__2004_-_present.png)

A contraction of the words finance and technology, fintech has become  increasingly bandied about in the media and in technology circles. Yet despite being in vogue, it's a term many – including tech savvy and clued up entrepreneurs – don't quite have a handle on. Indeed, it's a fresh enough term to not yet feature in the online version of the Oxford dictionary

Taken at its broadest, Fintech is shorthand for ‘innovation in financial services’, whether that means new products from new startups, or the adoption of new approaches by existing players where technology is the key enabler.

A recent report from Accenture found that global investment in fintech has skyrocketed from $930 million back in 2008 to nearly $3 billion in 2013. The UK and Ireland alone received over $700 million from investors between 2008 and 2013.

That being said, finance is nevertheless a slow-to-change industry where security concerns are always front of mind.

## FinTech in 2015
Bankers Are Leaving Finance for No-Salary Tech Jobs because they believe the industry is ready for disruption.

"As investment firms including UBS, Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc and Deutsche Bank AG have curtailed or shuttered lines of business, particularly in debt trading, the contractions have prompted former bankers to quit finance and put their experience to use in the new field of financial technology, or fintech."

"Technological advances are poised to have the greatest impact on banking, 86 percent of the bank chief executive officers surveyed by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP last year said."

### Startups to watch
I love this image entitled *Unbundling A Bank*. Sounds poetic almost.

Notice the large collection of wealth management startups on the right. We'll get to that a little late.

Forbes covers a few startups to watch and there's probably names you've heard of

# Why open source for Fintech?

>The disruption we may expect to see on the horizon is for firms to move from mere consumers of OSS to major co-developers, like their silicon valley  counterparts.”  ~ Jamie Edwards 

Firms want to avoid vendor lock-in. When you deploy an open source project, you control the code. You have the freedom to go without the developer, or to choose a third-party integration partner, if that’s what makes the most sense to your business.

Now, more than ever, firms need a lower total cost of ownership for software. Price competition is razor sharp and firms can't afford to spend cash on outdated license models. Breaking down monopolies tends to result in lower costs for end users. Open Source doesn’t equal Free, but it does usually mean a radically smaller price tag.

In addition to the cost benefits that can be realized by embracing open source, financial institutions are also able to enjoy greater levels of software innovation. 

For example, in areas such as cloud computing and big data, innovation is being driven by open source – in these areas of innovation it is no longer about whether to choose between a proprietary or an open source vendor, it is more about which of the open source vendors you choose."

"If they purchase new x86 commodity based hardware and migrate to a Linux operating system with an open source software stack on top, the ROI can be less than a year."

Even in this slow moving, highly regulated industry open source hasn't just found a foothold, it's an entrenched resource that most of the major players couldn't function without.

Banking platforms rely heavily on open source software for their infrastructure…



What about newer players in Fintech? Just take a look at these builtwith profiles:

Additionally, open source is also being used in the fascinating world of Financial Inclusion - the delivery of financial services at affordable costs to sections of disadvantaged and low-income segments of society.

There are many interesting examples of actual open source financial software aimed at helping to fulfill the overall mission of an open financial system. Check out Mifos and Cyclos, and Hamlets (developed by Community Forge), all of which are designed to help people set up their own financial institutions.

A leader in the financial inclusion movement is the Mifos Initiative - a community-driven initiative that is positioning financial institutions to become modern and digitally connected providers of financial services to the poor. They publish the Mifos X open source platform, which is distributed for free and covers common financial inclusion needs.

Finally, we're especially impressed by the polish of Opengamma, the open source risk and analytics platform. The high-profile funding they have received from industry leaders shows how far we have come in embracing open-source as a viable approach.

# Security Concerns
Open source software is more secure than you think. In fact, experts argue that the transparent nature of open source software does not make it any less secure.

It is also important to understand that validating a software’s security  strictly depends on your ability to audit it, to review it. The audit of software depends on access to the source code. 

While a new audit of a proprietary software depends on the willingness of the owner of the software, you can audit of open source software whenever you want.

This concern has become more and more severe as backdoors in well established software have been disclosed. If face of this, the ongoing debate on whether open-source software increases software security or is detrimental to its security has become pointless. Even though some of the arguments on either side are subjective and no relationship between number of vulnerabilities in an application and its open-source/proprietary status has been observed, both of them may contain backdoors. However, only open-source software can be freely audited and therefore, proprietary software must be considered inherently insecure.

https://www.schneier.com/crypto-gram/archives/1999/0915.html#OpenSourceandSecurity

"If I look at how people break software, they don't use the source code," Dr. Ian Levy, technical director at the UK's Communications-Electronics Security Group (CESG).

In fact, there’s a concept in software development known as "Linus' law" that says "given enough eyes, all bugs are shallow.”

In a commercial open source environment, no member is able to commit code without undergoing a through an approval process. Even after this any new code goes through a sophisticated process of review, acceptance and rejection. This process leads to well-tested, enterprise-ready software.

All that being said, there is no software system that is completely risk-free, but open-source software allows you to be proactive in detecting these risks.

# Why Wealth Management as the next step in open source fintech
With the advent of robo-advisors, the wealth management fintech segment is exploding right now.

Wealthfront is KPMGs 2014 innovator of the year.
Schwab just released their own "intelligent" portfolio.
And let's not forget about the entrenched TAMP players or legacy wealth management software that exists at firms like Merrill Lynch and xxxEdward Jones

At the same time, possibly due to improved investor education through resources like r/personal_finance and the boggle head forums, there's a trend away from sales oriented brokers to fee only investor advisors (aka wealth managers) with a fiduciary duty to the investor.

They are digital natives — they start digital, and build a business around a flexible core, taking mobility, social media, the web, and aggregated data for granted. While traditional banks anchored by cumbersome technology lumber to catch up, these fintech companies are leveraging social media and other technology to enable interactions that are entirely reshaping customer relationships.

In addition, the digital revolution is arriving later to wealth management than to other industries such as media and retail
because the wealthiest investors are older. However, as a $41 trillion bubble of wealth works its way down to Generations X and Y, it will behoove banks to cater to these populations who have grown up with technology, often prefer online services, and eschew relationships with traditional advisers.

Robo-advisors are taking the industry by storm. They are agile, powerful, and fast. And they are terrifyingly accurate.
But, they are also remote. Armed with the right tools, traditional advisors are ten times stronger because they have
the all-important quality of emotional intelligence to add to the mix.
http://solutions.yodlee.com/rs/yodlee/images/WP_Investment-Data-Quality_v1_R3.pdf


Robo advisors compete with investment advisors on the basis of lower costs and on the basis of higher trustworthiness. 

The truth is. a computer can't have an ulterior motive or a conflict of interest, but  with brokers and others that make a commission your investment, that can't always be said about humans. 

However, what happens if automation is just used to hide the conflict of interest? As we see in Adam Nashs teardown of Schwabs intelligent portfolio, there's other ways to extract a profit out the unwary investor.

“Cash has a significant chance of a negative real return over time due to inflation risk.

Cash assets can present a conflict of interest when the investment manager is advising cash and then re-investing it for its own revenue.

‘In a research paper published in Financial Analysts Journal last year, Vanguard founder John Bogle cited cash drag as one of the ways investors are not making the most of their investments.¹”

“One recent example is with Schwab’s new automated portfolio, one of the latest imitators of Betterment’s automated investing technology. Its new offering requires a cash position from a minimum of 6% to as much as 30% cash, according to Schwab’s disclosures.³”
https://www.betterment.com/resources/investment-strategy/the-real-cost-of-cash-drag/

“Why would an investment service purposely not invest almost a third of your account?”

To find the answer, Follow the money.


“You might not know this, but Charles Schwab no longer makes most of its money from trading or commissions. In fact, it generates over $1.7 billion per year from net interest revenue, almost 3x what it makes on trading commissions.”

That's why not only is fintech ready for open source but also why in our opinion, the wealth management segment specifically will be a fantastic proving ground for the next fintech open sourced platform.

With this in mind I'd like to introduce wealthbot.io - Wealth Management, Set Free.
